== Taking the next step

Before you run Keycloak in production, consider the following actions:

* Switch to a production ready database such as PostgreSQL.
* Configure SSL with your own certificates.
* Switch the admin password to a more secure password.

For more information, see the https://www.keycloak.org/guides#server[server guides].
