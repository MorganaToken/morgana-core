== Log in to the Admin Console

. Go to the {links-admin-console}.
. Log in with the username and password you created earlier.

== Create a realm

A realm in Keycloak is equivalent to a tenant. Each realm allows an administrator to create isolated groups of applications and users. Initially, Keycloak
includes a single realm, called `master`. Use this realm only for managing Keycloak and not for managing any applications.

Use these steps to create the first realm.

. Open the {links-admin-console}.
. Click the word *master* in the top-left corner, then click *Create realm*.
. Enter `myrealm` in the *Realm name* field.
. Click *Create*.

. Click *Users* in the left-hand menu.
. Click *Create new user*.
. Fill in the form with the following values:
** *Username*: `myuser`
** *First name*: any first name
** *Last name*: any last name
. Click *Create*.

This user needs a password to log in. To set the initial password:

. Fill in the *Set password* form with a password.
. Toggle *Temporary* to *Off* so that the user does not need update this password at the first login.
