title="Enabling Keycloak Metrics"
summary="Learn how to enable and expose metrics from the server"
includedOptions="metrics-enabled">

Keycloak has built in support for metrics. This guide describes how to enable and configure server metrics.

== Enabling Metrics

It is possible to enable metrics using the build time option `metrics-enabled`:

<@kc.start parameters="--metrics-enabled=true"/>

== Querying Metrics

Keycloak exposes metrics at the following endpoint:

* `/metrics`

The response from the endpoint uses a `text/plain` content type and it is based on the Prometheus text format. The snippet bellow
is an example of a response:
